                            While artificial intelligence (AI) is seen as a new phenomenon in mainstream society, it is not a new concept. As AI technologies increase, AI is becoming increasingly important for companies looking to stay competitive. <br>
                            <br>
                            <b>What is AI</b><br>
                            <br>
                            Artificial intelligence is a broad term for any computer software that engages in human-like activities. This includes learning, planning, and problem-solving. <br>

                    <b>Machine Learning</b> <br>
                    <br>
                    Many different types of artificial intelligence (AI) are used in business today. One of the main types is machine learning, which is primarily used to process large amounts of data quickly. These types of AIs are algorithms that appear to learn as they are given more data. <br>
                    <br>
                    Machine learning algorithms can analyze data that would otherwise be too complex for humans. Additionally, the algorithms can rapidly analyze data as it is entered and identify patterns and anomalies as they appear. <br>
                    <br>
                    Businesses can use machine learning to determine when equipment is working at a reduced capacity and inform decision-makers when preventative maintenance is required. Nevertheless, machine learning is still a relatively broad category. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Deep Learning </b><br>
                    <br>
                    Deep learning evolved as a result of the development of artificial neural networks. In deep learning, neural networks can perform nonlinear reasoning, a more advanced form of machine learning. Therefore, a deep learning model is essential for detecting fraud and conducting a more comprehensive analysis. <br>
                    <br>
                    The deep learning approach allows simultaneous analysis of a wide array of factors. Deep learning models continue to improve their performance as more data is received. For example, self-driving vehicles must simultaneously identify, analyze, and respond to numerous factors. As a result, deep learning models become more detailed and scalable as more data is received. <br>
                    <br>

                    <b>AI and business</b> <br>
                    <br>
                    Artificial intelligence is not considered a replacement for human intelligence and ingenuity. However, it can process and analyze data much faster than humans. As a result, AI can assist with anticipating possible outcomes and decision-making by providing alternative courses of action. <br>
                    <br>
                    AI is commonly used in cybersecurity, customer relationship management, content generation, and personal assistants. <br>
                    <br>
                    It is unlikely that human jobs will disappear as artificial intelligence becomes more integrated into the workforce. Instead, it is predicted that the need for specific skills will shift as technology advances, leading to a growing demand for more refined technical skills. <br>
                    <br>
                    Overall, AI is playing an increasingly important role in businesses today. As the technology continues to develop, it will be interesting to see how else AI will transform various industries. <br>
